# TRI10NWARE build journal

Every step of the build adds an entry here, newest at the bottom. The Status block below is updated at the end of every step; it is the first thing each new session reads.

## Status

- **Last completed:** M0 step 2, project settings, 2026-10-17.
- **Next step:** M0 step 3, input map (`/step M0.3`).
- **Waiting on the owner:**
    - Reopen Godot from `game/project.godot`. The renderer is now Compatibility, so the editor restarts into it. Until M0 step 7 creates `world/main.tscn`, the editor and the import step report that the main scene is missing; that is expected.
    - Push the tag: `git push origin prototype-v0`.
    - Fill in the license column for the three `game/art/legacy/` rows in `CREDITS.md`.
    - M0 step 0 prerequisites, still needed: the 4.5.1 export templates, the macOS bundle identifier, the itch.io project page, and access to a Windows PC. Godot 4.5.1 itself is confirmed at `/Applications/Godot 4.5.1 .app`.
    - Before M1 step 2: accept or replace the three proposed answers under "Decide before step 2" in the M1 build order.
- **Open questions:** none.

## M0 prep: workflow files (2026-10-17)

**What was built:**

- `docs/TRI10NWARE.md` (the spec), `docs/reference/` (the design and acceptance-criteria PDFs, plus the two Level 1 mockups cropped from design page 2).
- `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/skills/step/SKILL.md`, `.claude/agents/spec-reviewer.md`, and this journal.

**How it works:** each Claude session starts with no memory of the last one. `CLAUDE.md` loads automatically and tells the session where the spec is and which parts to read; the spec itself is too long to load every time. The `/step` skill walks a session through one numbered step: orient, plan, implement, test, explain here, commit. `.claude/settings.json` turns on in-chat explanations (the Explanatory output style), sets the path to Godot, and makes edits to the spec, the reference documents and owner art, and every `git push`, ask the owner first. The spec reviewer is a read-only helper for checking a finished milestone against the spec.

**Why:** "How an AI developer works from this document" and "M0 prep" in the spec.

**How to see it:** start a new Claude Code session in VS Code and type `/step M0.1`.

**Decisions and questions:** the M1 build order and the gym-painting hand-off were added to the spec with the owner's approval of the workflow plan.

## M0 step 1: migrate prototype repository (2026-10-17)

**What was built:**

- Tag `prototype-v0` on `d9a0053` (local only; the owner pushes it).
- Moved with `git mv` into `game/`: `project.godot`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `icon.svg`, `icon.svg.import`.
- Moved into `game/art/legacy/`: `player_v0.png`, `world_tileset.png`, `health.png`, each with its `.import` file (rewritten by the import step).
- Deleted: `player/player.gd`, `player/player.gd.uid`, `player/player.tscn`, `levels/level_1.tscn`.
- `game/.gitignore` trimmed to `.godot/` and `/android/`, plus `config/build_info.cfg`.
- New root `.gitignore`: `builds/`, `.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- New `CREDITS.md`: the asset register, with the three legacy files as `owner draft`.
- `tools/` and `builds/` created on disk (not committed; see below).

**How it works:** the repository root now holds only documents and tools, and the Godot project lives in `game/`, so `res://` means `game/`. Godot never sees the docs, and the docs never get `.import` files.

Files were moved with `git mv`, so git records them as renames. `git log --follow game/art/legacy/player_v0.png` still shows the prototype history. The prototype as a whole stays recoverable through the `prototype-v0` tag.

The headless import step rebuilt Godot's cache in `game/.godot/` and rewrote each art file's `.import` so that `source_file` points at `res://art/legacy/...`. The stale cache at the old root `.godot/` was deleted; it was never tracked.

`game/project.godot` is unchanged in content. Its `main_scene` still points at the deleted prototype level, so the import prints `Unrecognized UID: "uid://bvi1x41hav28d"`. That is expected until M0 step 2 rewrites every setting.

**Why:** spec "M0 step 1: migrate the existing repository" and "Repository layout"; AC D-08 (the project opens from the repository alone; asset attribution).

**How to see it:** open Godot and import `game/project.godot` (not the old root). Running the project will complain about the missing main scene until step 2. The three prototype images are under `art/legacy/` in the FileSystem dock.

**Decisions and questions:**

- *Decide and log:* `tools/` and `builds/` exist on disk only. Git cannot track an empty folder, the spec lists no `.gitkeep` for `tools/`, and `builds/` is ignored. `tools/` enters git in M0 step 10 with its scripts.
- *Decide and log:* `CREDITS.md` was created now, not in M0 step 11, because step 1.4 adds rows to it. It uses step 11's columns exactly; step 11 extends it. (Approved with the step plan.)
- *Deviation from step 1.1:* the tag is local. CLAUDE.md forbids the AI from pushing. Owner: run `git push origin prototype-v0`.
- *Question:* the license column for the three legacy images says "owner to confirm". Please fill it in.
- *Owner decision (2026-10-17):* `.vscode/` (personal VS Code settings) is ignored in the root `.gitignore`, and the spec's M0 step 1 `.gitignore` row was updated to match, with the owner's approval.
- Tests: none yet. The unit-test runner arrives in M0 step 9; verification was the import run, the rename status and the `.import` paths.

## M0 step 2: project settings (2026-10-17)

**What was built:**

- `game/project.godot`: every setting in the step 2 table. Changed: version `0.1.0`; main scene `res://world/main.tscn` (replacing the prototype's stale scene UID); Compatibility renderer for desktop, mobile and web (and the matching `GL Compatibility` feature tag); 1280 × 720 window override; `viewport` stretch, `keep` aspect, `integer` scale mode; pixel snapping on; physics interpolation on; jitter fix `0.0`; untyped declarations are an **Error**. Removed: the prototype's fullscreen window mode. The prototype's `[input]` block is untouched; step 3 replaces it.

**How it works:** Godot reads `project.godot` at startup, before any script runs. The game now draws everything onto a 640 × 360 canvas (`viewport` stretch) and scales that canvas up by a whole number only (`integer`), adding black bars instead of stretching (`keep`). Pixels therefore stay square and crisp at 2× and 3×. The window opens at 1280 × 720. Step 7's `main.gd` will grow it to the largest whole multiple that fits the screen.

The simulation clock is 60 physics ticks per second, and up to 8 ticks may run in one rendered frame, so at 30 FPS the game still advances 2 ticks per frame and never slows down. Physics interpolation smooths movement between ticks on displays faster than 60 Hz. It only changes what is drawn, never the simulation. Those first two values are Godot's defaults. Godot writes only non-default values to `project.godot`, so you won't see them in the file, but they were checked by reading them back.

With `untyped_declaration` set to Error, a script with any untyped variable, parameter or return value fails to load. That enforces ground rule 2 automatically.

**Why:** spec "M0 step 2: project settings"; "Starting decisions this plan depends on" (renderer, 60 ticks, 640 × 360); ground rules 2 and 4; AC V-01 (integer scaling) and D-04/D-05 (one renderer everywhere, frame-rate-independent ticks).

**How to see it:** reopen Godot from `game/project.godot`, then open Project → Project Settings with Advanced Settings on. The values match the step 2 table, and the top-right renderer label reads "Compatibility". Running the project fails until step 7 adds the main scene. Verified headless with a throwaway script that read all 23 settings back through `ProjectSettings` (23 passes; not committed, since the unit-test runner arrives in step 9).

**Decisions and questions:**

- *Decide and log:* removed the prototype's `display/window/size/mode=3` (exclusive fullscreen at launch). The step 2 table specifies a 1280 × 720 window by default, which launching fullscreen would contradict; fullscreen stays one key away through the `fullscreen` action (step 3, D-07).
- Not changed here: the prototype input actions, which step 3 replaces in full.
- No open questions.
